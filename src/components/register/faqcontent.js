        <br />
        Since we are all still in the middle of the pandemic and some of the pre

        <b>8. What will be evaluated? Is there any evaluation standard? </b>
        <br />
        We can’t set a standard to judge someone’s looks since it is very
        subjective. However we are looking for each person’s unique colors.

        <b>9. Does the photoshoot must be photographed in the studio? </b>
        <br />
